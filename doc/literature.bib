	Abstract = {Atmospheric and ground-based methods agree on the presence of a carbon sink in the coterminous United States (the United States minus Alaska and Hawaii), and the primary causes for the sink recently have been identified. Projecting the future behavior of the sink is necessary for projecting future net emissions. Here we use two models, the Ecosystem Demography model and a second simpler empirically based model (Miami Land Use History), to estimate the spatio-temporal patterns of ecosystem carbon stocks and fluxes resulting from land-use changes and fire suppression from 1700 to 2100. Our results are compared with other historical reconstructions of ecosystem carbon fluxes and to a detailed carbon budget for the 1980s. Our projections indicate that the ecosystem recovery processes that are primarily responsible for the contemporary U.S. carbon sink will slow over the next century, resulting in a significant reduction of the sink. The projected rate of decrease depends strongly on scenarios of future land use and the long-term effectiveness of fire suppression.},

@article{Shevliakova-Pacala-etal-2009a,
	Abstract = {We have developed a dynamic land model (LM3V) able to simulate ecosystem dynamics and exchanges of water, energy, and CO2 between land and atmosphere. LM3V is specifically designed to address the consequences of land use and land management changes including cropland and pasture dynamics, shifting cultivation, logging, fire, and resulting patterns of secondary regrowth. Here we analyze the behavior of LM3V, forced with the output from the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) atmospheric model AM2, observed precipitation data, and four historic scenarios of land use change for 1700--2000. Our analysis suggests a net terrestrial carbon source due to land use activities from 1.1 to 1.3 GtC/a during the 1990s, where the range is due to the difference in the historic cropland distribution. This magnitude is substantially smaller than previous estimates from other models, largely due to our estimates of a secondary vegetation sink of 0.35 to 0.6 GtC/a in the 1990s and decelerating agricultural land clearing since the 1960s. For the 1990s, our estimates for the pastures' carbon flux vary from a source of 0.37 to a sink of 0.15 GtC/a, and for the croplands our model shows a carbon source of 0.6 to 0.9 GtC/a. Our process-based model suggests a smaller net deforestation source than earlier bookkeeping models because it accounts for decelerated net conversion of primary forest to agriculture and for stronger secondary vegetation regrowth in tropical regions. The overall uncertainty is likely to be higher than the range reported here because of uncertainty in the biomass recovery under changing ambient conditions, including atmospheric CO2 concentration, nutrients availability, and climate.

@article{Wilson-Baldocchi-etal-2001a,
	Abstract = {Temporal trends in photosynthetic capacity are a critical factor in determining the seasonality and magnitude of ecosystem carbon fluxes. At a mixed deciduous forest in the south-eastern United States (Walker Branch Watershed, Oak Ridge, TN, USA), we independently measured seasonal trends in photosynthetic capacity (using single-leaf gas exchange techniques) and the whole-canopy carbon flux (using the eddy covariance method). Soil respiration was also measured using chambers and an eddy covariance system beneath the canopy. These independent chamber and eddy covariance measurements, along with a biophysical model (CANOAK), are used to examine how leaf age affects the seasonal pattern of carbon uptake during the growing season. When the measured seasonality in photosynthetic capacity is represented in the CANOAK simulations, there is good agreement with the eddy covariance data on the seasonal trends in carbon uptake. Removing the temporal trends in the simulations by using the early season maximum value of photosynthetic capacity over the entire growing season over estimates the annual carbon uptake by about 300 g C m−2 year−1-- half the total estimated annual net ecosystem exchange. Alternatively, use of the mean value of photosynthetic capacity incorrectly simulates the seasonality in carbon uptake by the forest. In addition to changes related to leaf development and senescence, photosynthetic capacity decreased in the middle and late summer, even when leaf nitrogen was essentially constant. When only these middle and late summer reductions were neglected in the model simulations, CANOAK still overestimated the carbon uptake by an amount comparable to 25% of the total annual net ecosystem exchange.},

@article{Strigul-Pristinski-etal-2008a,
	Abstract = {Individual-based forest simulators, such as TASS and SORTIE, are spatial stochastic processes that predict properties of populations and communities by simulating the fate of every plant throughout its life cycle. Although they are used for forest management and are able to predict dynamics of real forests, they are also analytically intractable, which limits their usefulness to basic scientists. We have developed a new spatial individual-based forest model that includes a perfect plasticity formulation for crown shape. Its structure allows us to derive an accurate approximation for the individual-based model that predicts mean densities and size structures using the same parameter values and functional forms, and also it is analytically tractable. The approximation is represented by a system of von Foerster partial differential equations coupled with an integral equation that we call the perfect plasticity approximation (PPA). We have derived a series of analytical results including equilibrium abundances for trees of different crown shapes, stability conditions, transient behaviors, such as the constant yield law and self-thinning exponents, and two species coexistence conditions.},

@article{Choudhury-Monteith-1988a,
	Abstract = {The model is an explicit solution of the equations which define the conservation of heat and water vapour in the system consisting of uniform vegetation and soil. The vegetation has two layers, the first extending from a reference height in the atmosphere to the virtual sink for momentum and the second from the virtual sink to the soil surface. Soil between the surface and the damping depth is divided into an upper, completely dry layer and a lower wet layer. Throughout the system, differences of potential per unit flux are specified by resistances, notably the conventional surface resistance governing the loss of vapour from foliage and a new soil resistance, assumed proportional to the accumulated loss of water by evaporation from the soil surface, which is proportional to the square root of elapsed time. Since the total energy available to the system is limited by absorption of radiation, the increase of transpiration from foliage as it expands decreases evaporation from the soil. Conversely, as soil dries, transpiration rate per unit of foliage area increases. This interaction of vapour fluxes is governed by the behaviour of the saturation vapour pressure deficit within the vegetation, identified as a major variable.

General implications of the model are consistent with observations and estimates of evaporation rate from a stand of wheat grown in Arizona agree well with measurements from lysimeters. The model is applicable to a wide range of problems in agricultural meteorology and hydrology. With simplification, it could be used to obtain surface exchanges of sensible and latent heat in atmospheric general circulation models.},

	Abstract = {Global biogeochemical models have improved dramatically in the last decade in their representation of the biosphere. Although leaf area data are an important input to such models and are readily available globally, global root distributions for modeling water and nutrient uptake and carbon cycling have not been available. This analysis provides global distributions for fine root biomass, length, and surface area with depth in the soil, and global estimates of nutrient pools in fine roots. Calculated root surface area is almost always greater than leaf area, more than an order of magnitude so in grasslands. The average C:N:P ratio in living fine roots is 450:11:1, and global fine root carbon is more than 5% of all carbon contained in the atmosphere. Assuming conservatively that fine roots turn over once per year, they represent 33% of global annual net primary productivity.},

	Abstract = {The surface sublayer is the layer of air adjacent to the surface where
	the transfer of momentum and heat by molecular motion becomes important.
	Equations are derived to incorporate this surface sublayer (or the
	variable ratio of the roughness length for momentum over that for
	heat, zo/zoh) over bare soil into a commonly used formulation for
	aerodynamic transfer coefficients. Along with the consideration of
	the laminar layer around vegetation leaves in the Biosphere-Atmosphere
	Transfer Scheme (BATS), these equations provide a consistent approach
	for the computation of surface fluxes over bare soil or vegetated
	surface.
	
	
	Qualitative and quantitative analyses show that the surface sublayer
	tends to substantially increase the surface skin temperature for
	a given sensible heat flux and decrease the heat flux for a given
	surface versus air temperature difference. Using a climate model
	output as the atmospheric forcing data for BATS over a semiarid region,
	it is also found that the surface sublayer significantly increases
	the monthly and July-averaged hourly surface skin temperature and
	decreases surface sensible heat and net radiation fluxes.
	
	
	Comparison with limited observations of zo/zoh also suggests that
	the same (or different) exchange coefficients should be used over
	bare soil and vegetated portions in a grid box for dense canopies
	(e.g., grassland or forest) [or sparse canopies (e.g., semiarid regions)].},
