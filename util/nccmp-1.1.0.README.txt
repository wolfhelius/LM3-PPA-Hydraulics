==============================================================================
                compiling nccmp 1.1.0 on Mac OS X (10.6.8)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(0) Using netcdf 4.1.3 from macports.

(1) configure:
LDFLAGS=-L/opt/local/lib CPPFLAGS=-I/opt/local/include ./configure
LDFLAGS="-L/opt/local/lib -search_paths_first" CPPFLAGS=-I/opt/local/include ./configure

(2) comment out the contents of getopt.c (#if 0 ... #endif)

(3) deleted line
#include "error.h"
    in nccmp-1.1.0/src/ncinfo/include/nc4internal.h

(4) in nccmp-1.1.0/src/ncinfo/test.sh, changed
ncgen=/usr/local/bin/ncgen
to
ncgen=`which ncgen`

Tests of ncinfo still fail, because header file size is not printed (possibly
soemthing wrong with nc4_find_nc_file function, it desn't seem to recognize
classic netcdf format).

(5) sudo make install
